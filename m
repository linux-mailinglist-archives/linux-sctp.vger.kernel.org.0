Good day dear,

I am very much pleased to reach you by faith believing that you will
accept this appeal for help and investment in good faith. I am Raphael
Kamara, the son of late Chief Vincent Kamara and I am a 17 years old
boy from Freetown Province in Sierra Leone. I am in the position of
US$7.5 Million which my late father deposited in fixed with a bank in
Cote d'Ivoire which he wanted to use finance his presidential
political ambition in our Country before he was affected with these
deadly corona viruses in his business trip to France in October 2020
that lead to his sudden death. This money was realized from royalties
and the alluvial gold dust sold during the war when my father was the
Chief of Freetown Province, Republic of Sierra Leone.

As his only child, I am presently taking refuge in Ivory Coast
following the death of my father and my stepmother was desperately
after my life because of my late father's wealth which he used my name
as the only Son to deposit the money in the bank as the next of kin. I
have decided to invest this money in your country or anywhere safe
enough outside Africa for security and personal reasons. I seek your
assistance to claim this money and have it move out of this country to
enable you to assist me plan for the investment outside this country
so as to enable me to plan for my future. I will give you 15% of the
money for your kind assistance to me. I will give you further details
as soon as I hear from you.

Best regards,
Raphael Kamara
