Good Day Dearest.

My name is Adeline Rodrigues I am 35 year's old, the only daughter of
late MR. RODRIGUES PASCAL JOSE from Burkina Faso, I am contacting you
to help me relocate to your country to continue my future in your
country, because before my father died he gave me a deposit slip
document of ($7.7 Million United State Dollars) and let me understand
that it was because of his position in government that his government
associates planed and poisoned him on a business trip with them to
France and he advised me to look for a faithful and reliable foreigner
who will help me to transfer this money to his country and help me to
relocate over there to continue my future.

I hope you will help me with good faith and trust I have in you, after
you have secured the money and settle staying in your country
peacefully, I will give you 40% of the money for your good and kind
assistance to me.

I waiting on your reply

Please reply me here email address: adrar2570361@gmail.com

Regards,
Adeline Rodrigues.
