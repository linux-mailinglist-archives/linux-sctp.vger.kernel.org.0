Attention:Dear Valued Customer



With all due respect our Valued Customer , I want to know personally
if you are alive because the information reaching this bank is
justifying that you are dead as a result of COVID -19.

This was observed in the second paragraph of an application submitted
from a lawyer on behalf of his client who told this bank that before
your death , you directed him to claim your outstanding
inheritance/winning payment of ( $5,500,000.00 ) Five Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars while you were still alive.

Do not take this email for granted otherwise , you are going to lose
it to the man because they are very consistent in their claims and
insist that you direct him to claim your fund on your behalf . If you
are alive, you are required as a matter of urgency to re- confirm the
below information.


(1) Beneficiary Details.

Your Full Name:
Your Address:
Your Mobile Number:
Your Age:

(2) Bank Details
