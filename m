Greetings,

My name is Mr.Aziz Mohammed, the account manager in charge of audit
Foreign Remittance Unit, bank  in Burkina Faso, It is true that we
have not meet each other in person, but I strongly believe in trust
and friendship in every business. As I am contacting you independently
of my investigation and no one is informed of this communication. My
reason for contacting you is to transfer an abandoned sum of
$10.5million Dollars  immediately to your private account. The money
has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without anybody
coming for the claim of it.

The funds belong to our deceased Customer Mrs.Shannel Lake who
perished along with her family since 9 years ago The Banking laws here
does not allow such money to stay more than 10 years, that is the
reason why I need your Cooperation in transferring the money to your
bank account so that we can use it to secure the future of our both
families because I don't want the money to be recalled to the bank
treasury as unclaimed fund.

By indicating your interest I will send you the full details on how
the business will be executed. Please keep this proposal as a top
secret and delete if you are not interested. My position as the chief
auditor in this bank guarantees the successful execution of this
(deal) transaction.

1)your full name.....
2) sex.....
3) age.....
4) country.....
5)passport or photo.....
6)occupation.....
7) personal Mobile number.....
8)Home &office address.....
9) Your marital status........

Thanks.

Mr.Aziz Mohammed.
