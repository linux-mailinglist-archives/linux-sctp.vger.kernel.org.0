Hello,

My name is Mr. LeRoy Christopher; I am a banker and the personal
account manager of one of our deceased clients of his nationality who
was a contractor of an oil and gas services company called
(PETRO-IVOIRE) here in Ivory Coast. The deceased client made a
numbered fixed-time deposit valued at: $ 5,726,405.00 (Five million
seven hundred twenty-six thousand, four hundred and five dollars) at
our bank branch before his disappearance.

The account currently has no registered relatives and the funds now
have an open mandate of beneficiaries. Therefore, I request your help
to present yourself as the next of kin of the deceased for the
acquisition of the outstanding amount of $ 5,726,405.00 (Five million
seven hundred twenty-six thousand, four hundred and five dollars) that
has been inactive in a suspense account with our bank since the funds
have stayed longer and now due to recovery; otherwise, the bank will
cover it as unclaimed funds and be returned to the government treasury
vault for its own use.

I will give you more details as soon as I receive your positive
response to run this lucrative business with me.

Regards,


Mr. Christopher
