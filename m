Hello Beloved,
My name is Madame Brigitte Wattab., German nationality. I am
contacting you to do something very important to me. It is quite true
that you do not know me and neither do I. I have cancer which is in
the terminal phase, my attending physician has just informed me that
my days are numbered because of my degraded state of health. According
to what the Doctor explained to me, a Ball is currently settling in my
cerebral cage, I have had this disease for more than 4 years. I beg
you to accept my donation.

I have the sum of (=E2=82=AC 3.500.000 Euros) as a donation. And beg you to
accept this amount as a donation as it could be very useful to you.
You must answer me if you accept my offer directly by my email: I feel
very bad, I can hardly sleep at night or during the day. I cannot die
without having donated all this money otherwise I think it would be a
waste. The Bible says that every time is chosen in due time and it is
time for you to receive these funds for the works of the Lord.

I wish you a good time and may the Almighty Lord protect you and your
family in the name of Jesus Christ Amen!

Thank you in advance for your attention.
Cheers, God Love You!
Mrs. Brigitte Wattab.
