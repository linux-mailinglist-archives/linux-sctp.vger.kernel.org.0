Hi my friend, I'm Mrs Qin. I work in a bank. Please excuse my english, if there are errors! First off, if we both survived the Covid-19 epidemic out break, then I believe that God has given each of us all a chance to do better and help humanity. Well, as a banker, I have a 100 percent guaranteed opportunity we can profit from without having to hurt anybody. We can both support the less privileged financially, and also our families in a very legal and risk free way. I have a deal worth a substantial amount of money, and I wish for us to partner together to accomplish it. Currently; Iâ€™m in total control of a dormant escrow account and the customer is deceased. But, that notwithstanding, my lawyer can appoint you as a relative to our deceased customer and have all his deposits directed to you as the next of kin without creating any problem for us. It will only take a little time to get the Paper-Works ready and once they are ready, then we are good to go. I can easily arrange this because our deceased customer recorded no next of kin. He opened his escrow account with our private banking department and my official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise and monitor the account. I hope you understand that rare opportunities like this only come one's way once in a lifetime? I mean, I cannot let this chance pass me by and I hope you understand because for once I found myself in total control and face to face with my destiny. These chances won't pass me by. I am a family woman and this is an occasion for me to provide them with new opportunities and a good life and also to help the less privileged. A maximum of fifty (50) percent may be offered as your share for being my partner. Therefore; if you agree to partner with me, then be rest assured that everything would be done accordingly to meet all legal requirement. I am using a very good lawyer who already has experience in such matters. We will do everything discreetly and quietly without any hitches. But you must promise to follow my instructions at all times. This is my field and I must guide you in order fo us not to make mistakes. Give me a chance for us to achieve this in a very easy way. Please let me know. Thanks! Regards, Qin
