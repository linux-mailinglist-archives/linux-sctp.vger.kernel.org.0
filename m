My Name is Mrs. Maureen Greaves, married to Late Alan Greaves (PhD}
who worked with Total S.A the French Multinational Integrated Oil and
Gas Company and one of the five "Super major" oil companies in the
world  as their Africa drilling rig supplier for 17 years before his
death On Christmas Eve 2013.

Before his death we were both devout born again Christian;
lay-preacher and former social worker and my late husband Alan
Greaves; was an organist at the church for 40 years, before his  was
attacked and beaten with a pickaxes on his way to play at Midnight
Mass at St Saviors Church in Sheffield and he died in hospital three
days later as you can confirm this link as stated below:

A year after his murder, organist Alan Graves' widow .

Christmas Eve last year played a leading role in an emotional
candlelit service at the spot where he was attacked .

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of ($15.5M) with a
bank in Cotonou Benin where he worked for 17 years last as the
(TotalS.A.) Africa drilling rig supplier.

I am contacting you because of the recent report from my Doctor told
me that I have some weeks to live due to cardiac and kidney failure
problem, having known my condition, I seek your concept and permission
to present you to the bank as as my late husband foreign investors to
retrieve the fund and utilize for establishing an orphanages home for
the poor and needy, and also propagating the word of God and to
endeavor that the house of God is maintained.

I shall give you the full detail documents of the fund as soon as I
hear from you.
Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another good
person for this same purpose. Hoping to receive your response
immediately; Thanks and Remain blessed in the Lord. I Remain yours
sister in Christ.
Mrs. Maureen A. Greaves
